    <h1>Renewable Energy Projects in Australia</h1>
    <p>
        Australia has seen rapid growth in renewable energy projects over the past decade. 
        This visualisation explores the distribution, growth, and types of renewable energy projects 
        across the country. We will take a closer look at where these projects are located, how capacity 
        has increased over time, and the proportion of energy types that make up Australia’s renewable 
        energy landscape.
    </p>

    <h2>Geographic Distribution of Projects</h2>
    <p>
        The map below shows the geographical distribution of renewable energy projects across Australia. 
        Each circle represents a project, with its size corresponding to the capacity (in megawatts) 
        and its color indicating the type of energy (Solar, Wind, Hydro). Hover over each circle to see 
        more details about the project, including its name and year of operation.
    </p>

    <h2>Growth of Renewable Energy Capacity Over Time</h2>
    <p>
        Renewable energy capacity in Australia has been growing steadily. The line chart below illustrates 
        the cumulative capacity of renewable energy projects over time, segmented by energy type. This chart 
        provides insight into which types of renewable energy have seen the most growth and which have emerged 
        as the dominant sources of clean energy in recent years.

    <h2>Proportion of Renewable Energy Types</h2>
    <p>
        Renewable energy in Australia is diverse, but some types are more prominent than others. The donut chart 
        below shows the proportion of each energy type—solar, wind, and hydro—in the total renewable energy capacity. 
        This helps us understand the overall contribution of each type to the country’s energy mix.

    <p>
        These visualisations highlight the increasing role of renewable energy in Australia's energy sector. As we 
        continue to move towards sustainable energy solutions, understanding the growth and distribution of these projects 
        is crucial for planning future developments and making informed decisions.
